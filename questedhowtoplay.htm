<p>
The tutorial will start the player in a battle already and with only one character, being Larrow, the starter. The first wave will be a weak minion for the character to defeat. The game will tell them to click on the enemy to attack them. After a few hits the minion will die, and Larrow would have not taken much damage, and wave two will begin. This time, the minion has a lot more health, so the game will teach the player to click a different move to use that move to attack when they click on an enemy. So the player will click the Sharp Shooter attack and kill the enemy in one hit. Wave three will now begin. The final wave of every level will always be a boss fight. The boss in this level will not be strong, and will be tested to lose, even if Larrow used his basic attack until it died. After the fight is over, the game makes the player return home. The level that was just played can't be replayed, since it will not be able to be found anywhere. A tour will now be given to the player, so they will now know how to get back to adventure mode, do social activities like sign in, find quests, rewards, mail, and lastly summons. A free summon will be given to the player whom will have to use it and get Sir Alexander guaranteed. Normally, there would be a lot more characters found, but just for the tutorial Sir Alexander will be given. Now that the player has two characters, the game will try to make the player find adventure mode without pointing to it. Any way that does not lead to adventure mode will have the game say "This is not the right way to get to go fight people" and prevent the action from performing. When the player gets to the first level, the game will make them add Sir Alexander to the team, and then begin the level. During the fight, the game will teach the player about element strengths and weaknesses, like fire is weak to water. A Type Table will be given to the player so they can use it anytime in battle to see which element is good to what, and this can be disabled in the options menu. There will be multiple enemies per wave now, and some will have the Electric element, which is weak to Larrow, the Magic element, which is strong to Larrow, but weak to Sir Alexander, and the Fire element, which is strong to Sir Alexander. The boss in this level will be a giant werewolf, which can win against the player, but to prevent that, if there is one character left for the player, that character will not drop below one health point. When the battle is over, the character will become a level two, and get enough diamonds to afford a summon. Then the game has the player learn how to upgrade characters, so they have more attack, defense, health, skill, stronger synergy, etc. When a new gamemode gets unlocked, the game will teach the player how to play it, and when a character can tier or star upgrade, the game teaches the player how to do that as well.

<p>
The Adventure Mode is the story in the game. This would be a primary way to collect character tokens to summon them, and other rewards will be given like materials and upgrades. There will be 180 levels, 20 chapters, and 5 difficulties. Normal difficulty is unlocked instantly, Hard difficulty is at level 20, Extreme, at level 40, and same pattern for Insane and Legend. When the difficulty goes up, not only the level recommendations go higher, but also there are more restrictions for the higher the difficulty gets. It will also give better rewards and experience. There are also six Legend Bosses spread out across the chapters, the first Legend Boss at chapter four. Lots of achievements can be found in Adventure Mode, which means even more rewards can be given to the player.

</header>
<article style="top: 0px; right: 170px; overflow: auto">
<p>
Arena Mode is the online PvP in Quested. Arena mode has two sub-modes, being raid and live modes. In raid mode, a player would use a team they have built to battle an offline player with a defense the pre-made, and the winner steals gold from the other, and if the attacker wins, they get platinums (currency for the arena shop), not stolen, and steal extra gold. Although, the defense does get to attack first, to not only balance out the extra rewards, but also it would be as if they noticed raiders coming, and were already prepared to fight. There is a global and national leaderboard, which gives out rewards every Saturday or Sunday (not decided which yet) and the rewards are a lot better for the higher the ranking. The rewards would be incredible for a mid-game player, even though that will be almost impossible to one to have since there are high level players. Live Mode is like Raid Mode, but live. An online player will put in some gold to gamble with, and will be paired with similar gamble amounts, level, and current ranking. the winner will get all the gambled gold extra platinums (more platinums for the more gold gambled), and trophies, which determine the ranking of the player. Like the Raid Mode, there will be rewards given weekly for Live Mode, and the rewards are better in general. The reason why is, this mode is not pausable, you can't get a team that counters the opposing team (unlike Raid Mode), the internet speed could be a problem, and the opposing team is controlled by a player instead of a bot.

<p>
Survival Mode is a mode where there are endless waves of characters to battle, and you get a break every five waves, a boss wave being every five waves as well. Characters will not regenerate between waves, and if you end a group of waves with a dead character, they can no longer be revived for the remainder of the run. The groups of waves will increasing get much more difficult as well. Although, during breaks you can change your team. Even taking a character off the team will not heal them. The rewards multiply by nearly 1.2x for every group of waves completed, and there will be a leaderboard for most waves completed in one run. You can't do more than one run per four hours.

<article style="top: 0px; right: 170px;">
<p>
Random Mode (name could change) is self-explanatory in the name. It is a PvP mode, but all teams are randomized. This includes the characters, runes, order, and more. All characters will be max level and upgrades. When you click on this mode for the first time, you will be shown around the mode, how it works, and what you can do. When you start a game, but never played, you will be asked to get a randomized team. You do get two rerolls, and if you reroll, you can't use the previously shown team. After finishing the match, you will be asked if you want to save the team you used, if it is not already saved. When a team is saved, it can be viewed at any time (except during battle), and will be saved in a built-die, so you could battle friends with that team. You need six teams in order to roll the die, and any new extra saved teams will be put in your personal Randomizer Gallery, which you can replace with a team in the built-die. You can't use the built-die against random opponents. If a team is not saved, it will go away, and might never be seen again, seeing how low the chances are to find the exact same team.

Alliance War Mode

</header>
<article style="top: 0px; right: 170px; overflow: auto">
<p>
Alliance War Mode is the mode where alliances collide with each other to fight for big rewards. To start a war, both alliance generals will have to agree, by one general sends a war invitation to the other, who can accept at any time, both generals must be over level 30 and not be more than five levels apart, and each alliance must have more than ten members. The duration of the war is decided by the inviter, and the general who got the invitation can see what the inviter decided. The war could be one hour long, twelve hours, one day, three days, five days, one week, two weeks, or one month long. When an alliance war starts, every alliance member is notified through mail and have time to prepare. The preparation time is determined by the duration of the war, but it does not affect the duration of the war. During preparation, each alliance can easily find the alliance they are about to go to war with, and can see their current defenses. Preparation may include strengthening your offense and defense teams, and collecting shield fragments to be immune to being attacked for a few hours. When the war begins, each alliance will get the same amount of tokens, then they will be split across the alliance equally. The math behind this may get complicated, so it won't be shown. During the war, when you decide to battle, you will be given an option between five random opponents to battle. You can't refresh the opponents, and when one is battled by you, When the war is over, each person will get rewards, one pack of rewards for whether you have won the war or not, and another for the amount of tokens you had at the end.

<p>
Puzzle Mode is one of the most simple gamemodes of them all, but could be the most difficult. With this mode, there will be a team to defeat, and there would be a set number of teams you could use. The number of possible teams may vary depending on the difficulty level, which there are five different difficulties to pick from. Of course, the more difficult the puzzle, the better rewards. The rewards get smaller for the more attempts you make, and after five attempts, you fail the challenge and the correct answer will be offered to be shown to you.

Ghost Tower Mode
</h1>
</header>
<article style="top: 0px; right: 170px; overflow: auto">
<p>
Ghost Tower Mode is a mode where there would be a tower to climb with a team to battle on each tower. There are probably going to be 15 floors and the final floor is a boss fight. Like Survival Mode, if a character loses health or dies, they stay with that lowered health or dead until the tower is completed or abandoned. The twist between this mode and Survival Mode is that you have no way of telling who the enemies are. They are all ghosts. They all look the same, and the only difference is possibly the level. When an enemy chooses to use a move, a random ally (or self) uses it instead. They still have the abilities they would normally have, but you can't check them. The final boss may be randomized between a few that are not battle found anywhere else in the game. Using a plan based on the enemies won't be an option. There are good rewards and a leaderboard for completing floors. Whenever you are not battling, you can choose to abandon the ghost tower. If you do, the tower falls apart, so you can't return to it, and you will have to wait 24 hours to battle a new one. If you complete the tower, you will get very good rewards, potentially a new character, and you will have to wait 18 hours for a new tower.

Creation Mode is where you get to create your own character! Build abilities, moves, skins, whatever you want. These characters will only be able to be used in Local Battle Mode, but that is the only limit. Build who you want, let imagination go wild. This mode will not be ready by the time of release, and will come out for an update eventually.
